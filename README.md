# Setup

After cloning the repository and loading it into your preferred IDE, you should navigate into the "backend" directory with the command: `cd backend`

To run this program, you will need Node.js. This can be installed from their website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Having done this, there are a series of packagae installs you will need to run the `app.js` file.
1. Firstly, you will need to install **Express** using the command `npm install express`.
2. Next, install **Node-Fetch** using the command `npm install node-fetch`.
3. Lastly, install **Node-Cache** using the command `npm install node-cache`.

# Run
Now that we have all the necessary packages we need and we are in the `/backend` directory, we can run the program with the command: `node app.js`
